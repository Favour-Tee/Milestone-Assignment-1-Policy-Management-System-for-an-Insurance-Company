## Overview
This is a simple Python-based Policy Management System for an insurance company. The system allows for managing policyholders, products, and payments. It includes functionality to:
- Register, suspend, and reactivate policyholders.
- Add, update, and suspend products.

The system demonstrates the functionality by creating two policyholders, associating them with a product, and processing their payments
